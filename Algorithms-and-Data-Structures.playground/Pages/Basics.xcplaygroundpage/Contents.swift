 # Basics
 
 ## Complexity
 How the algorithms performs in terms of time and memory consumtion as input increase.
 
 ##  Big O
 Big O is the way we describe the performance efficiency or complexity of algorithms.

 **Time Complexity** - is a measure of time required to run algorithms as the input increase.
 * Constant time - has the same run time regardless of innput size. `O(2)`
 * Liear time - rase the same as input increase. `O(n)`
 * Quadratic time - n squared. Algroritms where times increase proportional to square of the input. `(On^2)`
 * Logarithmic time - Algorithms whic cah shortcut base on input. `O(log n)`
 * Quasilinear time - multiplication of linear and logarithmic time complexity. `O(n*log n)`
